Throughout my academic journey at BIT, I developed a robust foundation in both technical and design principles, underpinned by an industry-oriented curriculum and hands-on experience. I am passionate about leveraging technology to craft seamless, engaging digital solutions that prioritize user experience, efficiency, and innovation.
My commitment to continuous learning drives me to stay updated with the latest trends and methodologies in both design and development. I excel at translating complex requirements into intuitive, functional applications, always with a keen eye for detail and usability.
Eager to contribute to pioneering projects and dynamic teams, I am dedicated to advancing impactful, user-centric technology in the ever-evolving digital landscape.    </p>
